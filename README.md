Working with Node to generate a readme

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project is made using Node. The user will have a generated readme at the end of the questions prompted

HOW TO USE PROJECT: The user will start by putting in the prompt, node index.js - from there the user will be prompted with several questions about what they would like to put in the readme. From there, the readme is generated 

I want my code to be more concise so it is not too much in certain areas.
